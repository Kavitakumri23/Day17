📅 Day 17 – Insertion Sort
Today I implemented and practiced the Insertion Sort Algorithm using Java.

🔍 What is Insertion Sort?

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to how we arrange playing cards in our hands.
It divides the array into sorted and unsorted parts.
One by one, it picks an element from the unsorted part and inserts it at the correct position in the sorted part.
